You prepare for one last moment but suddenly the ship lurches and your colleague yells that the ship is out of control. The ship accelerates and you get slammed into the couch feeling your bones creek while your first mate is eerily silent. The ship accelerates again and it all goes black. You wake up in near darkness with only the emergency life support system on. You try to look out of the glass but it is covered in metal clearly showing that it broke. You go to find your partner but all you can find is blood next to the window. Suddenly a light appears and the ship slowly fades away. Within complete darkness now blue letters appear...
